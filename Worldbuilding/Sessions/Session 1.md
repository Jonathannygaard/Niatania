> Welcome to [[Niatania]]. A world at peace. We are in late may, 1530 TOI (time of independence) and you have found yourself in a small town called [[Littlevale]]. The biggest producer of Apples in [[Elarion]]. 

The characters hear rumors in the village that a neighboring city has been attacked. The only survivors talk about a shadow running over the land, with glowing eyes and a lust for blood.

If the characters dig deeper they might ask [[Jorren Kettlebrow |Jorren]], [[Lyra Applewhistle|Lyra]] or [[Sila Windfern|Sila]] if they know something. They all talked to a human who came through the tavern 3 days ago. He came talking about the shadow. He was wounded and got some help from [[Sister Calvine Mossroot|Sister Calvine]] before he continued south towards the capital. 

If they approach the neighboring village they will find a goblin camp on the way. 

Possible characters you may meet:
- [[Captain Brynn Aldershade]]
- [[Edda “Redbranch” Thornbrook]]
- [[Garruk “Stone-Eye” Brann]]
- [[Lyra Applewhistle]]
- [[Sister Calvine Mossroot]]
- [[Rin Ashbloom]]
- [[Jorren Kettlebrow]]
- [[Sila Windfern]]


We have just finished the first session, where the player characters started inn this city. They proceeded to rob Sila. They then proceeded to the market where one of the player characters then robbed a farmer of a lot of mushrooms. While another set fire to a field of apple trees. They then gathered before one tried to rob the owner of a potion shop, a powerful wizard. A little later another player character shot a guard in the leg before all of them tried to rob the owner of the stables. In the end they ended up killing the owner then taking the money the spent earlier and more. They then killed a guard before setting fire to farmland and the potion shop. They then escaped on the horse and wagon. Can you help me develop the story of the characters you created before? Most of them never met the player characters, but are surely affected by what has happened in their village.

Oh wow — your players just turned your cozy apple village into ground zero for chaos 😅 That’s great fuel for story, though, especially since most of the NPCs never directly met the party. The key now is to think about how **news spreads, emotions rise, and consequences unfold** among the villagers you’ve built. Let’s play it forward:

---

## 🌳 Aftermath in the Village

### **1. [[Edda “Redbranch” Thornbrook]] (Farmer)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Devastated — her apple orchards are literally burning. She curses the “outsiders” and weeps in the fields, gathering whatever she can salvage.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** She’ll have to rely on the community’s help to replant, and she might become a driving force pushing for justice against the party.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Starts organizing angry villagers into a **watch group** to protect the crops, even if that means arming themselves with pitchforks.
    

---

### **2. [[Captain Brynn Aldershade]] (Village Leader)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Shocked at the scale of destruction in a single day — robbery, murder, arson. Brynn instantly declares a state of emergency.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Orders patrols of militia to hunt the party down. Sends messages to nearby towns and possibly a **larger lord or military order** for reinforcement.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Brynn may treat this like an **act of war**, rallying the village under her command. Could even call upon the outpost’s buried past for aid (underground tunnels, forgotten armory, or worse).
    

---

### **3. [[Garruk “Stone-Eye” Brann]] (Retired Soldier)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Furious but grim — he sees history repeating itself (outsiders bringing ruin). He begins patrolling the edges of the village with his old sword.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Starts drilling villagers in simple combat techniques. Garruk will absolutely **take it personally** that guards were slain, as many were his former trainees.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Might become a relentless hunter of the PCs, using his knowledge of the land and old tunnels to ambush them.
    

---

### **4. [[Lyra Applewhistle]] (Bard)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Writes an instantly popular (but tragic) ballad about the “Night of Ashes,” spreading word quickly to other towns.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** She unwittingly turns the village’s tragedy into **legend** — ensuring the party’s reputation (good or bad) spreads far.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** If she ever meets the PCs, she might play a mocking or vengeful tune about them in taverns, tarnishing their names everywhere they go.
    

---

### **5. [[Sister Calvine Mossroot]](Healer)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Overwhelmed treating burn victims, wounded guards, and grieving families. Bitterly angry, but she channels it into her healing work.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Begins researching whether she can use **forbidden magic** from the outpost’s old archives to defend the town in the future.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Could be an unexpected antagonist later — someone who arms herself with dangerous spells to prevent another attack.
    

---

### **6. [[Rin Ashbloom]] (Tiefling Youth)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Terrified but also fascinated by the chaos. Rin idolizes adventurers, but this was far more violent than the stories.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Might be drawn toward dangerous rebellion — either trying to **emulate the PCs** as “heroes of destruction” or swearing to **avenge the village**.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Years later, Rin could resurface as a powerful figure — either ally or enemy — directly shaped by what the PCs did.
    

---

### **7. [[Jorren Kettlebrow]] (Tavern Owner)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** His livelihood takes a huge blow with Sila being robbed and the tavern shaken by rumors. Furious and shaken, he now sees the PCs as personal enemies.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** He may try to **fund bounty hunters** to track the PCs down, since his wealth comes from trade connections.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Sends word along caravan routes, putting a **price on the party’s heads**.
    

---

### **8. [[Sila Windfern]] (Bartender)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Humiliated and angry after being robbed — her pride is stung even more than her purse.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Sila becomes hardened, taking her old militia training seriously again. She may even volunteer to lead militia squads.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** She becomes a **personal rival** to the PCs, swearing to drag them back to the village in chains.

## ⚔️ Escalation Path: How the Story Could Grow

1. **The Village Reacts** – Fires are fought, dead are buried, and the survivors swear vengeance. The PCs have made enemies of an _entire community_.
2. **Word Spreads** – Lyra’s songs and Jorren’s caravans carry the tale, giving the PCs a growing reputation as dangerous marauders.
3. **Outside Response** – Brynn appeals to higher lords, militias, or even a knightly order. A **bounty is declared** on the PCs’ heads.
4. **Lingering Fallout** – Crops lost, families broken, businesses destroyed. Even if the PCs leave, this story follows them. They may encounter survivors (or mercenaries hired by them) in other towns.
5. **The Outpost’s Secret** – Brynn or Sister Calvine might, in desperation, awaken something beneath the outpost (sealed magic, cursed weaponry, or an imprisoned entity) to defend against further attacks. This could spiral into _a new arc where the PCs face the consequences indirectly_.
