## 1. **The Burnt Caravan**

### Scene Setup

As the party approaches Stoneford, they see smoke still curling from the husk of a **merchant wagon**, half-burned and pulled off the road near the main gate. Several guards stand around, grim-faced, while a scribe takes notes. A few scavenger crows circle overhead.

### Details

- **Victims:** Three merchants (burned, charred remains) and two guards (dead with deep, _raking_ wounds). One mule survived, half-burned and restless.
- **Evidence:**
    - The wagon was torched with something hotter than oil fire — the wood has blistered, stone in the road is blackened.
    - The guards’ bodies have **claw marks** instead of weapon wounds.
    - A faint smell of **sulfur** lingers.
- **Witness:** A surviving boy (stablehand apprentice) hid in a ditch. He swears he saw **“a beast of shadow with burning eyes”** tearing into the guards before the fire consumed the wagon.
### What’s Really Happening

- The attack was staged by the **[[The Crimson Shroud]]** ([[Erysia|Erysian]] bandit faction). They used a **[[Summon Dragon]]** spell to destroy the caravan.
- Their motive: disrupt [[Stoneford]]’s supply lines, sow fear, and force merchants to rely on their “protected routes.”
### Hooks for PCs

- PCs can investigate the wreck → uncover bandit activity
- The guards may hire them to track down the culprits.
- If they follow the trail → they’ll find **signs of [[The Crimson Shroud]] scouts** watching the roads.
## 2. **The Disappearance in the Quarry**

### Scene Setup

[[Stoneford]]’s eastern edge is dominated by a **large stone quarry**, where pale grey limestone is cut and shipped to build towns across the region. Recently, several quarry workers have **vanished without a trace**. The foreman insists it’s accidents, but the townsfolk whisper otherwise.

### Details

- **Missing Workers:** Four men and one woman gone in the past two weeks. No bodies, no tools found.
- **Odd Signs:**
    - A quarry pit has collapsed unusually, leaving a **jagged fissure** leading downward.
    - At night, workers claim they hear **scraping and whispering** from the depths.
    - Some tools have been found bent or broken, as though something immense had stepped on them.
- **Foreman’s Denial:** [[Garrick Flintmar]], the dwarven foreman, insists it’s “just bad luck” and wants the town to stay calm. He’ll be annoyed if the PCs pry, but secretly fears the truth.

### What’s Really Happening

- The quarry collapsed into an **old subterranean passage**, part of the ancient tunnels tied to the banished gods.
- Something has awakened — maybe:
    - **Quarry Wights** (undead bound to the stone, whispering for release).
    - Or a **Patron-spawned creature** feeding on workers and dragging them below.
- Cultists of the **Ashen Vigil** may already know and are subtly pushing things toward chaos.

### Hooks for PCs

- Families of the missing beg the PCs to investigate when guards refuse.
- PCs exploring the fissure can uncover remnants of old summoning circles, linking back to the **banished gods’ imprisonment**.
- Success could earn them Stoneford’s gratitude (or suspicion, if they delve too deep).
