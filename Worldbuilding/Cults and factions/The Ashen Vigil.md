## Religion: The Ashen Vigil

###  Core Beliefs

1. **The Soil Feeds the Divine:** The villagers believe that the health of the land and crops directly sustains [[The Ashen Harrower]]. Corruption and decay are seen as necessary for ultimate growth and power.
2. **Strength Through Fire and Vengeance:** Trials, destruction, and retribution are sacred. [[The Ashen Harrower|The Harrower‚Äôs]] blessing comes through acts of boldness, vengeance, and defense of the village.
3. **Chosen of the Shard:** Those who consume the black-red apples or participate in rituals are considered ‚Äútouched‚Äù by the [[The Ashen Harrower|Harrower]], gaining strength but also a permanent bond to its will.
4. **Cycle of Ruin and Renewal:** Life, harvest, and death are all intertwined. Decay is not evil‚Äîit is preparation for the next growth.
