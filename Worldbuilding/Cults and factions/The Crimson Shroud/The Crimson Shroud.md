_A criminal faction with roots in Erysia, extending its influence into the frontier city of [[Greymoor]]._

---
# **Overview**

The Crimson Shroud is a **bandit–crime syndicate hybrid**. They present themselves as common thieves, but they’re highly organized, with safehouses and informants in every trade hub leading back to Erysia.

- **Symbol:** A blood-red sash worn as a mask or armband.
- **Tactics:** Extortion, smuggling, robbery of caravans, information brokering.
- **Influence in [[Greymoor]]:** Control smuggling through the river docks, protection rackets in taverns, and several merchants who quietly pay them to avoid trouble.

## **Leadership**

- **[[Silvara Veyne]], “The Crimson Viper”** _(Human Woman, Assassin)_ – Rumored leader of the Crimson Shroud in [[Erysia]]. Elegant, cunning, and merciless.
### [[Greymoor]] 
- **[[Harl Grint]]** _(Human Thug Captain)_ – [[Greymoor]] cell leader; runs shakedowns in the market district, hides out in the sewers.
- [[Veyra Quicktongue]]: Runs the tavern and gambling, keeps morale high.
- [[Kaelen The Ox Durn]]: Keeps order in the fighting pits and intimidates rivals.
- [[Sereth Malven]]: Ensures guards "look away" when shipments move.
- [[Liora Veyth]]: Handles trade, laundering and luxury contraband.
- [[Jerrik Rat's-Ear Morn]]: Provides intel and keeps everyone alert. 
##  General Presence

- The Crimson Shroud operates through **cells**, each semi-independent but sworn to the Erysia bosses.
- In **[[Greymoor]]**, their goals are:
    1. Control the **black market trade** of alchemy supplies, exotic goods, and illegal magic.
    2. Recruit **disaffected youth** and mercenaries who resent [[Greymoor]]’s leadership.

## Relationships

- **With [[Lord Dorian Thistledown]] (the city’s Lord): They despise him — his taxes make “business” costly. Still, they bribe a few guards to look the other way.
- **With the common folk:** Mixed reputation. Many fear them, but poorer folk see them as a “necessary evil” that provides work, loans, or “protection.”
- **With [[Erysia]]’s bosses:** [[Harl Grint]] answers to them, sending tribute and reports. Failure = punishment.

## Fronts & Influence in [[Greymoor]]

1. **[[The Ashen Tankard]] (Tavern & Gambling Den)**
    - Run by _[[Veyra Quicktongue]]_, a half-elf woman with a sharp laugh and sharper knife.
    - Publicly, it’s just a rowdy tavern. Privately, it’s where debts are collected and contracts are signed.
2. **[[Black-Lantern Smugglers]]**
    - A group of riverfolk and sailors who smuggle contraband through the lake docks.
    - Symbol: a lantern painted black, hung on a post to signal “safe” routes.
3. **Corrupt Guards**
    - A handful of the city watch take “extra pay” to ignore certain shipments or to “lose” paperwork.
    - [[Harl Grint|Harl]] has at least 3 loyal guards in his pocket — though they won’t risk open rebellion.
4. **[[The Crimson Pit]] (Underground Fighting Ring)**
    - An abandoned mine shaft turned into a secret pit-fighting arena.
    - Attracts mercenaries, miners, and even bored nobles looking for bloodsport.
    - Used as recruitment: those who fight well are invited to “join the Shroud.”

## Hooks & Rumors

- Some say [[Harl Grint|Harl]] is trying to **ally with whatever darkness now festers in Littlevale** — though the Erysian bosses don’t know this yet.
- A drunken guard let slip that a whole **wing of the city watch is compromised** — but who’s on the payroll?

 This way, you can weave the Crimson Shroud into your campaign however you need:
- As an **enemy faction** working against the PCs.
- As a **shadow ally**, offering shady jobs.
- Or as a **mirror to the PCs’ own crimes** (since they already robbed and burned their way through Littlevale).
