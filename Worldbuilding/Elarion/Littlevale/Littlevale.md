![[Littlevale.png]]

Littlevale is a small farming village with a population of roughly around 300 people. They are a strong village, in the middle of [[Elarion]]. The village is built around a abandoned military base used in the wars after [[Banishment day]]. The village still has a strong militia watching over them. They serve the royal family of [[Havenswift]], however don't have a steady communication with [[Erysia]]. 

Littlevale is known for their apple farms and it is their biggest export. Alongside apples they also produce all kinds of vegetables, however that is mostly used in the village and not exported. They are mainly self sufficient, except for minerals and tools which they get directly from [[Mornladuhr]] in the north as they have a trade agreement with them. 

The village has a smaller population of around 240 people. The head of the village is the village chief [[Captain Brynn Aldershade]]. Along with leading the village, she's also the captain of the militia here. Littlevale works as an outpost for [[Erysia]]'s army. As the [[Havenswift]] family both fear and respect the dwarves. 

After the first apple harvest in late August Littlevale holds the [[Apple festival (Littlevale)]]. The whole village celebrates a good first harvest and the city is filled with decorations.  The people stay up all day to mingle, drink and eat all kinds of apple related foods.

## üå≥ Aftermath in the Village

### **1. Edda ‚ÄúRedbranch‚Äù Thornbrook (Farmer)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Devastated ‚Äî her apple orchards are literally burning. She curses the ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and weeps in the fields, gathering whatever she can salvage.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** She‚Äôll have to rely on the community‚Äôs help to replant, and she might become a driving force pushing for justice against the party.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Starts organizing angry villagers into a **watch group** to protect the crops, even if that means arming themselves with pitchforks.
    

---

### **2. Captain Brynn Aldershade (Village Leader)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Shocked at the scale of destruction in a single day ‚Äî robbery, murder, arson. Brynn instantly declares a state of emergency.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Orders patrols of militia to hunt the party down. Sends messages to nearby towns and possibly a **larger lord or military order** for reinforcement.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Brynn may treat this like an **act of war**, rallying the village under her command. Could even call upon the outpost‚Äôs buried past for aid (underground tunnels, forgotten armory, or worse).
    

---

### **3. Garruk ‚ÄúStone-Eye‚Äù Brann (Retired Soldier)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Furious but grim ‚Äî he sees history repeating itself (outsiders bringing ruin). He begins patrolling the edges of the village with his old sword.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Starts drilling villagers in simple combat techniques. Garruk will absolutely **take it personally** that guards were slain, as many were his former trainees.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Might become a relentless hunter of the PCs, using his knowledge of the land and old tunnels to ambush them.
    

---

### **4. Lyra Applewhistle (Bard)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Writes an instantly popular (but tragic) ballad about the ‚ÄúNight of Ashes,‚Äù spreading word quickly to other towns.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** She unwittingly turns the village‚Äôs tragedy into **legend** ‚Äî ensuring the party‚Äôs reputation (good or bad) spreads far.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** If she ever meets the PCs, she might play a mocking or vengeful tune about them in taverns, tarnishing their names everywhere they go.
    

---

### **5. Sister Calvine Mossroot (Healer)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Overwhelmed treating burn victims, wounded guards, and grieving families. Bitterly angry, but she channels it into her healing work.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Begins researching whether she can use **forbidden magic** from the outpost‚Äôs old archives to defend the town in the future.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Could be an unexpected antagonist later ‚Äî someone who arms herself with dangerous spells to prevent another attack.
    

---

### **6. Rin Ashbloom (Tiefling Youth)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Terrified but also fascinated by the chaos. Rin idolizes adventurers, but this was far more violent than the stories.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Might be drawn toward dangerous rebellion ‚Äî either trying to **emulate the PCs** as ‚Äúheroes of destruction‚Äù or swearing to **avenge the village**.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Years later, Rin could resurface as a powerful figure ‚Äî either ally or enemy ‚Äî directly shaped by what the PCs did.
    

---

### **7. Jorren Kettlebrow (Tavern Owner)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** His livelihood takes a huge blow with Sila being robbed and the tavern shaken by rumors. Furious and shaken, he now sees the PCs as personal enemies.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** He may try to **fund bounty hunters** to track the PCs down, since his wealth comes from trade connections.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** Sends word along caravan routes, putting a **price on the party‚Äôs heads**.
    

---

### **8. [[Sila Windfern]] (Bartender)**

- **Immediate Reaction:** Humiliated and angry after being robbed ‚Äî her pride is stung even more than her purse.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Sila becomes hardened, taking her old militia training seriously again. She may even volunteer to lead militia squads.
    
- **Possible Story Beat:** She becomes a **personal rival** to the PCs, swearing to drag them back to the village in chains.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Escalation Path: How the Story Could Grow

1. **The Village Reacts** ‚Äì Fires are fought, dead are buried, and the survivors swear vengeance. The PCs have made enemies of an _entire community_.
2. **Word Spreads** ‚Äì Lyra‚Äôs songs and Jorren‚Äôs caravans carry the tale, giving the PCs a growing reputation as dangerous marauders.
3. **Outside Response** ‚Äì Brynn appeals to higher lords, militias, or even a knightly order. A **bounty is declared** on the PCs‚Äô heads.
4. **Lingering Fallout** ‚Äì Crops lost, families broken, businesses destroyed. Even if the PCs leave, this story follows them. They may encounter survivors (or mercenaries hired by them) in other towns.
5. **The Outpost‚Äôs Secret** ‚Äì Brynn or Sister Calvine might, in desperation, awaken something beneath the outpost (sealed magic, cursed weaponry, or an imprisoned entity) to defend against further attacks. This could spiral into _a new arc where the PCs face the consequences indirectly_.
