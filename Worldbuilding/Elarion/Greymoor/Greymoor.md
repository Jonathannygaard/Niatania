- **Population:** ~14,000 (diverse mix, but mostly human and dwarf merchants; notable gnome and halfling quarters).
- **Role in the Region:** Major trading hub in the centre of Elarion, built along the [[Greymoor River]] which leads south to Erysia. Known for its **river markets** and **caravanserai** (resting places for caravans).
- **Atmosphere:** Bustling streets, strong city guard presence, a feeling of opportunity—but also rumor and unease after hearing about the fires in Littlevale.

##  Key Features

- **The River Markets:** Barges docked along the [[Greymoor River]] where traders sell exotic wares.
- **The [[The Ironward Bastion]]:** The city’s fortress, home to the Captain of the Guard. Overlooks the entire city. 
- **[[Moonveil Square]]:** Central plaza with entertainers, preachers, and rumor-mongers.
- **[[Ashen Quarter]]:** Poorer, smoky district—blacksmiths, tanners, and miners live here. (Perfect for shady dealings or cult influence.)
- **[[Sanctum of the Silver Flame]]:** A temple devoted to the **banished but still-venerated gods of light and harvest**, making it a sharp ideological contrast to [[The Ashen Vigil]].

##  Current Rumors (regarding Littlevale)

- “The apples turned black, I heard!”
- “They say the villagers burned their own orchards in some blood-rite.”
- “No suspects? Hah! Always some damned travelers stirring trouble.”
- “Captain Brynn? She wouldn’t fall to darkness… would she?”
- (PC hook) A **few witnesses** _did_ mention “outsiders seen leaving the village that night” but no names or descriptions are confirmed—yet.
