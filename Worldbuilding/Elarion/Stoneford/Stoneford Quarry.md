### Roleplay Use

- They’re **not meant to be soldiers**, but if armed with their quarry tools, a mob of them can be dangerous.
- More useful as **flavor NPCs** during conflicts — helping Garrick, joining a strike, or panicking during a bandit raid.
- You could quickly scale them up to a **“Quarry Guard”** version (AC 13, HP 22, CR 1/2) if Garrick has trained some to keep order.
