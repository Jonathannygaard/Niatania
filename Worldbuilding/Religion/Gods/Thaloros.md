### Patron Shard

**[[The Jester of Thorns]]**

- Appearance: A masked, half-skeletal figure with a wreath of roses and thorns, juggling glowing motes of sound. Its body flickers between carnival colors and shadow.
- Voice: Ever-changing — sometimes laughter, sometimes weeping, sometimes many voices overlapping like a crowd.
- Promise: _“Dance and you’ll never fear silence. Sing and you’ll never know despair. But all music ends — and when it ends, so do you.”_

### Religion of Thaloros

- **Rituals:** Followers celebrate with festivals called **Wild Nights**, where music, fire, and dancing last until dawn. In these gatherings, inhibitions drop, secrets are revealed, and sometimes lives are changed forever.
- **Priests:** Often bards, tricksters, or masked figures who bless travelers with songs. Priests are more “hosts of revelry” than preachers — they lead with charisma, not doctrine.
- **Temples:** Rarely buildings — instead, holy places are found wherever laughter echoes: taverns, traveling wagons, theaters, and forest clearings where dancing once shook the earth.
- **Sacred Rites:** Instruments are considered holy conduits. Breaking an instrument in anger is blasphemy.

### Mortal Views

- **Beloved by common folk** who see him as a bringer of joy, courage, and forgetfulness from hardship.
- **Feared by the devout** of stricter gods — his worship often encourages chaos, indulgence, and dangerous excess.
- **Entertainers, musicians, and bards** call on him for inspiration, swearing by his name before performances.
- Some believe Thaloros’s laughter was the last sound heard when the gods were banished — a mocking song to echo through eternity.

### Symbol

- **A Mask with One Smiling and One Weeping Face** (often painted in bright colors or carved in wood).
- Sometimes accompanied by a flute or lute wrapped in thorny vines.
- Travelers and performers wear small charms of this mask, painted half-gold, half-black.
