# God of Knowledge & Secrets
### Alignment: Good

- **Domains:** Learning, hidden truths, magic.
- **Patron Shard:** **[[The Whisper in Glass]]** — A faceless figure inside a floating glass orb, always reflecting the observer’s image instead of its own.
- **Religion:** Scholars and mages offer ink, writings, or memories in exchange for insight. Secretive sects (_[[The Order of the Shattered Lens]]_) believe knowledge must be guarded, not shared freely.
- **Mortal View:** Both revered and feared. Some call him a trickster who tests mortals by giving too much knowledge.
### Symbols:
- **Symbol:** An open eye with a broken quill through it.
- **Patron ([[The Whisper in Glass]]):** A circle divided into shards, always asymmetrical.
- **Used by:** Scholars hide the eye-mark in book margins; cultists carry crystal pendants etched with fractured lines.
