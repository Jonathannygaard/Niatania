### Role in the Encounter

- **Support Lieutenant:** She strengthens cultists, makes the battle more chaotic, and is dangerous if ignored.
- **Synergy with Brynn:** If Sila is nearby, Brynn feels more like a **commanding general** with a second-in-command enforcing her will.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Dropping her into the same orchard fight (with Brynn + Calvine) increases the encounter’s adjusted CR to **~12 (17,500 XP adjusted)**—keeping her as a solid “second-tier” threat.
