## Apple farmer in [[Littlevale]]

- **Race:** Halfling
- **Personality:** Warm, talkative, and fiercely proud of her orchards. She claims she can tell the year an apple was grown just by sniffing it.
- **Quirk:** Uses an old, rusted sword as a walking stick — it’s a relic from when her family helped defend the outpost.
- **Secret:** Keeps a hidden stash of “[[Edda’s Fire-Cider]],” a strong brew that can knock out an ogre.

- Supplies apples for the entire village — cider, pies, and even medicine.
- **Connections:**
    - Provides apples to the tavern for cider (regularly argues with the bartender about fair prices).
    - Good friends with [[Sister Calvine Mossroot|Sister Calvine]], who often asks for apple bark or blossoms for remedies.
    - Has an almost motherly fondness for Rin, despite Rin’s constant tree-climbing mischief.


## Aftermath in the village

After the [[Summoning of The Ashen Harrower]] Edda was quick to worship the patron after the patron regrew her fields. Her skin quickly became pale from the apples and she helped grow the apples for the cultist feasts.
