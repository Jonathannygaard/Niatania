# [[Nature]]

[[Elarion]] is divided by [[Nature]]. The south is a fertile land with rivers running through it and big grasslands. This is where most of the population of [[Elarion]] lives. In the last 100 years the forests here have shrunk quite a lot as the population have expanded their farmlands.

The north side is dominated by a mountain range. There are some towns in the mountains, mainly [[miner colonies]] and [[dwarf cities]]. This is where 80% of all minerals in [[Elarion]] is mined and the only known source of [[Drakenshards]] in all of [[Niatania]]. The [[Drakenshard]] mines are mostly owned by the [[Dwarves]].
