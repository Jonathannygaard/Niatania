![[20250827_1453_Weathered Dwarf Miner_simple_compose_01k3nsbbvmfe8rwdmxzc73mchk.png]]
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 142 (middle-aged for a dwarf)
- **Occupation:** Quarry Foreman of Stoneford
- **Appearance:**
    - Stocky and broad-shouldered, built from years of stonework.
    - Grey-streaked black beard, always braided tight to keep clear of dust.
    - Wears a heavy leather apron over sturdy miner’s clothes, always covered in chalky limestone dust.
    - His left hand is missing two fingers, lost in a quarry collapse years ago.

---
### Personality

- **Gruff & Pragmatic** – Garrick doesn’t mince words and prefers results over speculation.
- **Overworked Leader** – Responsible for dozens of quarrymen, he balances safety with meeting quotas.
- **Stubbornly Denying** – Doesn’t like admitting he can’t control a situation; quick to dismiss “superstitious nonsense.”
- **Protective** – Beneath his gruffness, he genuinely cares about his workers and fears for them, though he hides it behind barked orders.

---

### Quirks

- Chews limestone dust-soaked tobacco, leaving a faint chalky streak at the corner of his mouth.
- Talks to the stone walls as if they’re old companions: _“Don’t you go crackin’ on me, girl.”_
- Keeps a polished fragment of obsidian as a lucky charm — from the collapse that nearly killed him.

---

### Connections

- **[[Stoneford Council]]:** Trusted but constantly pressured to deliver more stone to fund the town’s expansion.
- **Workers:** Loyal to him, though whispers spread that he’s ignoring the quarry disappearances.
- **Cultists:** Unwittingly digging near an ancient underground site. His stubborn denial makes him an easy pawn.

---

### Secrets

- He knows about the recent **odd fissure** in the quarry but is covering it up, afraid if word spreads, the quarry will be shut down and he’ll be blamed.
- He has seen strange **scrapings and sigils** on stone uncovered in the collapse — though he refuses to admit it.
- His late brother once dabbled in forbidden rites; Garrick fears the quarry may have broken into something his family would have known about.

---

### Use in Play

- **As an Obstacle:** He might brush off PC questions, urging them to leave it alone.
- **As an Ally:** If convinced, he’ll support the PCs with workers, equipment, or maps of the quarry.
- **As a Victim:** If ignored too long, Garrick himself might be taken in the night, pulling the PCs deeper into the mystery.

### Roleplay Notes

- Garrick isn’t meant as a major combat challenge but more as a **gritty, hard-to-kill NPC** the players can fight alongside.
- He’s excellent for **flavor encounters** (e.g. holding off cultists while the PCs escape, rallying workers in a strike, or surviving a quarry collapse).
- If you want him to be more of a risk in combat, you could give him a **CR 2 variant** with stronger hit points and a “rockslide” action, representing him using quarry tools and the environment against enemies.
