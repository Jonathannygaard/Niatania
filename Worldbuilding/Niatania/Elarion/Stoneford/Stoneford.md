- **Size & Role:** A **small fortified town**, built around a stone bridge that spans the river (hence its name). It’s smaller than [[Greymoor]] but strategically vital, since all trade from the dwarven holds must cross here.
- **Atmosphere:** Practical, earthy, slightly suspicious of outsiders. Known for its strong stonework, hearty food, and frequent militia drills.
- **Population:** ~1,200 (mostly humans and dwarves, with a scattering of halflings).
