The world of [[Niatania]] is filled with [[magic]] and mysteries. Flying through the universe. [[Niatania]] started as a ball of pure arcane potential. The potential was flowing, but never taking form. This is when the [[Gods]] arrived. They were drawn to the potential flowing and decided to use it. They started by forming the world. Separating the land from the water, pulling mountains towards the sky and starting life through [[Nature]].

The first race the [[Gods]] created were the [[Aasimar]]. After the [[aasimar]] they created the [[humans]], [[elves]] and [[dwarves]]. The [[Gods]] loved their creations and continued making all the [[races]]. 

Civilization quickly emerged throughout all of [[Niatania]]. The [[Gods]] kept ruling and engaging with the population for many thousand of years.

[[The time of the independence]] 

After [[Banishment day]] the world has settled into peace, however rumors are spreading of some people powerful with the arcane in [[Drekhmir]] are trying to open the gates for the Evil [[Gods]] allowing them to rule the world freely.
